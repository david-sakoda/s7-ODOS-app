# SPI registration profile

## Building
To build the custom SPI execute the following from within this directory:
```
mvn clean package
```

Copy the JAR file generaged from ./target to the <KeycloakInstall>/standalone/deployments folder. 

Note: If using Docker, this will be taken care of for you.
